# Income-Level-Classification-Using-1994-US-Census-Data
This project uses the 1994 US Census Income dataset (48,842 records, 14 features) to build machine learning models that predict whether an individual’s annual income is ≤$50K or >$50K based on demographic and work-related attributes such as age, education, occupation, hours worked, and capital gains.
